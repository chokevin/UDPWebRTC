WebRTC UDP Data Channel Latency Testing
===

A tiny serverless* WebRTC for UDP Data Channel latency testing,
<br>
inspired by https://github.com/cjb/serverless-webrtc and https://github.com/webrtc/samples and https://github.com/xem/miniWebRTC

*no signaling server, but the STUN server is still necessary and used.
